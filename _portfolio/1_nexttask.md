#### **SUMMARY**

NextTask is a simple to-do list (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_blank">SPA</a>) app built with *Angular.js* and *Firebase*. It uses the Firebase *AngularFire* module to provide a real-time backend with three-way data binding. It is designed to keep your to-do lists clean and realistic by removing tasks that are not completed within seven days. The idea is that if a task is not important enough to be completed within seven days, it does not belong on your to-do list. Expired tasks are still available under the Expired list, but they will be cleared from your Current list.

#### **TECHNOLOGIES USED**

JavaScript, jQuery, Angular.js, Firebase, HTML5, CSS3, AngularFire, UI Bootstrap, Node.js, Git

#### **EXPLANATION**

The goal of this project was to create a straight forward to-do list application with JavaScript, Angular.js, and Firebase that uses three way data binding to allow the application real-time application updates without refreshing the page. It was created according to user stories provided in my <a href="http://bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc</a> *Full Stack Developer apprenticeship* curriculum.

NextTask has a clean, mobile responsive design and uses *<a href="https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/" target="_blank">UI Bootstrap</a>*'s Modal service as well as *<a href="https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web" target="_blank">FirebaseUI</a>* for user authentication.

Once a user logs in they will be directed to the tasks index view where they can create new tasks, mark tasks as complete and view any expired or completed tasks.

Users can log out by clicking the "Logout" button in the top right. Logging out destroys the user session.
