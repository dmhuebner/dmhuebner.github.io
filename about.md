Hello!

I'm David,

I'm a multi-disciplined, fast learning web developer with a passion for technology. I come from a background in Linguistics and have since applied my knowledge of language structure and syntax to the art of web development.

I have been teaching myself to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for over a year now and decied several months ago it was time to greatly accellerate my education. My goal? To obtain a job in Web Development.

I'm currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Developer coding bootcamp with <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> and I'm really enjoying it so far. This site was built to showcase my projects as I build more and more of them as well as provide a platform for me to blog about my journey through web development. Thanks for stopping by! Please feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact</a> me if you would like to get in touch.
