title: Last Month of Bloc Apprenticeship

I’m nearing the end of my *Full Stack Developer Apprenticeship* at **Bloc** and it has been quite an experience. I have been lucky enough to keep my job as a Technical Support Representative but drop down to 30 hours a week to give myself more time to focus on my Web Development apprenticeship.

I’m feeling excited with my newfound and constantly growing skill set and significantly intimidated by my forthcoming job search. I have learned an enormous amount of material in the past six months and I’m currently focusing on building up my portfolio of web applications so I can demonstrate what I can do and how I code.

When I go after a job, my typical approach has always been to zero in on a few positions that I would really like to get. I usually just focus on a few rather than going wide and applying to a hundred or so different jobs. However, with the search for an awesome web developer job, I’m told I’ll need to apply to as many positions as I can find and be prepared for a lot of rejection.

I just need to find that perfect job that sees what I can bring to the table. Sure, I may not have years of experience or even come from a traditional background of formal Computer Science college education. But, what I lack in experience or tradition, I make up for in volition. I’m a passionate, lifelong learner and I cannot wait to sink my teeth into my first developer job!
